                    Let’s talk Birthdays! Looking back on my childhood, I have fond memories of my birthday celebrations. I remember the friends and family who helped me celebrate and the feelings that the parties gave me, I also remember some of the décor (think streamers, balloons, and matching character accessories). I certainly have no memory of my first few birthdays, and to be honest, neither do my parents. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Like most things though, birthdays have evolved over the years. The pressure from society has gotten to these once simple yet meaningful occasions. As soon as I gave birth to my son the chatter amongst my fellow mothers revolved around “the big day” and not the wedding day mind you, but the first birthday celebration. The event of the year as most would describe it. Pinterest boards were created, party planners were recommended, it was legit.  It was overwhelming and yet I found myself caught up in the hype. I created a Pinterest board, I came up with a theme (based on a book he had no concept of), and I started gathering materials. Over the course of the year I spent countless hours planning the event; from mapping out the guestlist to creating the menu and having the perfect “Smash Cake”.

                <p>
                    When the actual day came, it was, as you can imagine, not at all like I had planned. The morning was chaotic, I had to finish all the last-minute preparations and get the food made and perfectly laid out (because, all this had to be documented via pictures and social media). I barely spent time with my son, the very reason for celebrating in the first place. Don’t get me wrong, it ended up beautiful, my son seemed to have a good time, and my friends and family were pleased, and impressed. Phew.

                <p>
                    In the end it just got me thinking, and trust me, I thought it from the beginning, I just couldn’t hop off the crazy train I had boarded with my one-way ticket.  I was committed to celebrating like I was “supposed to”. Here’s the point though… Are these birthday parties for our children or are they for us? I know our intentions for these parties are pure. Also, who doesn’t want to celebrate bringing life in to this world (and let’s be honest, we did keep them alive for a whole 365 days despite the high expectations, anxiety and sleep deprivation!) it’s just we have to admit that they really aren’t parties for them, they’re for us. Is that okay? Sure. If that’s something you feel is important to you and your family. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I just ask you to think about this moving forward --  are you choosing to celebrate your children’s birthday in a way that will create memories that they will carry with them? Are you honoring their special day with things that they will truly enjoy? Or are you doing all these things because you feel like it is something you have to do-to keep up with society's pressures.  If you chose the latter answer, consider this -- for my son’s second birthday, after all the self-reflection of course, we had a small party with a theme we knew he would love (he was obsessed with farm animals), we invited just the people he spends his time with and we really simplified it to keep his wants and needs in mind. It was such a manageable event and one he truly enjoyed. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    On his actual day of birth though, we had a grander plan (remember that pressure society puts on us). We would wake up early, head to Boston and enjoy the day exploring the Science Museum with a nice lunch at one of our favorite restaurants. He was turning two! What were we thinking?! Well there we were again getting all carried up in the hoopla of doing something extra special, not stopping to realize that what would really be special for our toddler would simply be spending the day together as a family doing what he loves; exploring the great outdoors. So, at the last minute (around 3 am to be exact, when I woke up realizing I was crazy) we changed our plans. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    We woke up, made my son his favorite pancakes and went to the local state park (Maudslay Park-Newburyport, amazing spot) for a family day in nature. We spend the morning exploring the woods as a family. We ran with the dog, hugged trees, threw rocks in a brook, got muddy, and saw endless smiles on our birthday boy’s face. We even captured some of our favorite pictures to date. Our son got to spend a day with his family doing what he loved best. That is undoubtedly what made the day special and meaningful. While I’m certain that there would have been fun moments if we headed to Boston as originally planned, there would also have been moments of chaos, stress, and a feeling from our son of being overwhelmed and inevitably overtired. We’d reach the afternoon and be so ready to go home and for the day to be over. Our edited plan however, provided a feeling of not wanting the day to end-and what better feeling is that, especially with a toddler?!

                    My hope in sharing this is that you may take a moment to reflect upon what made your childhood celebrations special before you get carried away with what you think you should be doing. When you “follow the child” you are providing opportunities for them to explore their interests and curiosities creatively which will create meaningful moments and ultimately lay the foundation to their lifelong love of learning!
