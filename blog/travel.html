                    Let’s talk traveling with littles! This is a topic I am especially passionate about, because not only do I love my littles, but I also love to travel. When I’m not physically traveling, I’m planning the next getaway.  I crave all things travel, from standing in security lines at Logan (call me crazy), to the feeling of the wheels going up on the runway, to all the mundane and grandiose adventures along the way. The smells of different foods, the sights of different landscaping -- you get the point, I’m obsessed. I knew that when I had children I would still travel, maybe even more than before having them. Not only because I would no longer have to follow the school vacation calendar, but because of how much value I think traveling adds to a child’s life.

                    Unfortunately, I don’t always receive the most positive reactions or reflections to my traveling lifestyle. Some people have even gone as far as to say that it is selfish of me to “drag my children all over the world for my own interests”. However, the inspiration for this blog came when I recently ran into a former co-worker who shared her positive thoughts on my traveling lifestyle. She let me know that she was inspired by and genuinely happy for me and my ability to continue doing something that means so much to me with my new family. All that being said, I’ll be honest, travel pre-kids and post- kids is different. Not bad -- just different. It isn’t always relaxing or full of romantic and inspiring moments. It absolutely has its challenges (what rewarding things in life don’t) and it can be downright stressful! However, I truly believe that traveling offers unlimited opportunities for big important lessons and offers many meaningful moments that allow and encourage growth.

                    So, what big lessons am I talking about, you ask? Patience (that’s a big one). Flexibility. Cooperation. Appreciation. Kindness. Understanding. Cultural Diversity. Awareness. Mindfulness. Respect.  How can you argue with providing all that? Packed up in unforgettable experiences, boundless explorations and family bonding?
                </p>
                <p>
                    When people ask how I do it, how I work through the challenges and actually enjoy traveling with my littles, there are a few things I suggest. First, we must practice all of the above lessons ourselves (being mindful is key here). We must practice patience and flexibility. Dare I say embrace the chaos (even those pesky security lines). We must appreciate those around us, and the places which we visit. It’s important to appreciate the good times and the difficult ones. The difficult situations make the easy ones much more enjoyable. Above all though, we must show kindness and respect even in the most difficult of situations.

                <p>
                    The last thing I suggest which really applies to all of life’s situations is simple, observe your child(ren)! They most certainly will show you (and likely the entire full flight) how they are feeling or responding to the stresses of travel. It is crucial to stay attuned to their behaviors and to provide the guidance which they need in the moment to successfully navigate these challenging or overwhelming situations. It is important to note that while we cannot completely prepare our children’s environment (space) while traveling, we can prepare ourselves to offer some of those same expectations and comforts. So, in summary, be mindful. Relax. Embrace the chaos!... and most importantly, enjoy the adventures with your family. “The things he sees are not just remembered; they form a part of his soul.” -Maria Montessori
