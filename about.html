                <span class="card-title">Erin Marchal</span>
                <p class="card-content">Erin Marchal, M.Ed, has more than twelve years experience working with children and their families in official capacities.  She is trained through the American Montessori Society and holds an Early Childhood Educator credential as a certified 3-6 teacher.  She has taught full-time in Montessori classrooms for over a decade. During that course of experience she has provided guidance and support to parents, supervised and mentored newly trained Montessori teachers, and continued her studies of child development.</p>

                <p class="card-content">Erin has worked throughout her life with children of all ages in a variety of environments.  She attended the University of New Hampshire, where she received her BA in Communication. Over the course of her college career she dove into interpersonal communication content, craving deep understanding of human relationship and ways to express her empathetic nature with others.  When she became a teacher she found that her focus on communication was integral to forming meaningful relationships with those in her community.</p>
                
                <p class="card-content">Erin is passionate about working with children and their families in schools and at home.  She believes that education is driven by the intrinsic human needs to grow and learn; and to foster education is to support the entirety of a child’s development.</p>  
                
                <p class="card-content">Her years of experience with children, deep desire to support others, and ability to see the greater realistic picture helps guide parents toward deeper understanding of their children's developmental needs.  She strongly believes that “Our knowledge of how humans develop fuels our capabilities to guide our children.”</p>
                
                <p class="card-content">Erin is a 200-HR Registered Yoga Teacher, and has led yoga classes for those aged 3 to adults. In addition to teaching weekly classes at her local studio, she has integrated yoga into her classroom and provided a weekly class for colleagues. Through her own daily practice and teachings she has come to see that the practices of yoga and mindfulness support a healthy, balanced life. She currently lives in southern New Hampshire with her husband, where she loves sitting down with a cozy drink and good company.</p>

                    <p class="card-content">She holds an AMS Early Childhood Educator credential and is in the final stages of completing her BA in Early Childhood Education. She is diligent and passionate about continuing her education and in keeping up with current and relevant practices. She attends workshops and participates in professional development opportunities regularly.</p>
                    
                    <p class="card-content">It is through her new role as a mother that Jacqui’s passion for sharing her knowledge and experience with the Montessori philosophy and child development has emerged.  She is confident and excited to build relationships and grow the community of parents, caregivers and educators working to build the next generation of children. </p>
                    
                    <p class="card-content">Jacqui lives on the seacoast of Massachusetts with her husband, son, and dog. She enjoys traveling, swimming, cooking and exploring all the area has to offer with her family.</p>
